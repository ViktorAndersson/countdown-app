# Countdown App

A responsive countdown app built with **Angular** and **TypeScript**.  
Users can set an event name and date, and the app shows a live countdown that automatically resizes to fit the screen.  
A random quote is also fetched from [https://dummyjson.com/quotes/random](https://dummyjson.com/quotes/random) on each page load.
